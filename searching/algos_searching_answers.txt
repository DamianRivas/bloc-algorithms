1. It would take 7 iterations to find `G` using linear search.

2. It would take 3 iterations to find `G` using binary search.

3.  fib(10) = 55
    fib(11) = 89
    fib(12) = 144

I would use linear search on unsorted items and binary search on sorted items
because binary search only works on sorted collections.
